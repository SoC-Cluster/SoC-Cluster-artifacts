## Structure

- videos/: 6 handpicked videos from [vbench](http://arcade.cs.columbia.edu/vbench/).

- code/: scripts to run video transcoding benchmark.

- archive_throughput_power.md: archive video transcoding benchmark for throughput and power consumption.

- live_streaming_throughout_power.md: live streaming video transcoding benchmark for throughput and power consumption.

- energy_efficiency.md: benchmark for energy efficiency with different number of live video streamings.

- video_quality.md: video quality benchmark.

- video_bitrate.md: video bitrate benchmark on SoC CPU and SoC hardware codec.

## Note

In our code, we sometimes use *offline* to represent *archive* video transcoding, and use *online* to represent *live streaming* video transcoding.
